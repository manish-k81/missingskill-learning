# Basic Building Block Of Web Development

## Internet Protocol

---

- IP stands for internet protocol.
- IP has two categories:
  - IPv4
  - IPv6
- IP address can be public as well as private which means it can be available to everyone and it can also be used only in an particular organization or comapany.
- Any application can be powered by IP address.

## Classes Of IPv4

| Class       | Description                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| A (0-127)   | It is reserved for local system |
| B (128-191) | It is used for internet         |
| C (192-239) | It is used for local network IP |
| D (224-239) | Not used / Reserved             |

## PORTS

- **Ports** are an entery point to any application.

| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1023        | No other application can use this port other than system admin |
| 1024-49150  | They are application ports                                     |
| 49151-65535 | They are open ports                                            |

## Web Ports

---

- Whichever web application we run on a server uses the ports (80 & 443) by default. These ports are also known as _HTTP Ports_.

## Web Servers

---

- They also run on port 80 & 443 they are kind of applications where your web servers are hosted.

- Some examples : Nginx , Apache 2.0 .

## HTTP Verbs

---

| Request Methods | Description                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| GET             | It is used to fetch the data .  |
| POST            | To send the data to the server. |
| PUT             | Updating the data.              |
| DELETE          | To delete the data.             |
| OPTION          | It used for queries.            |
| HEAD            | It also used for queries.       |

## HTTP Headers

---

- Any request which comes from the server will have a header.
- They are manily used for communication between server and client in both directions.

## HTTP Ports

| HTTP ports       | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 100              | For information Responses                           |
| 200,201,202,204  | All the successfull request and responses uses this |
| 300,301,302      | It is used for migration                            |
| 400,401,402,403, | User authentication / Check                         |
| 500,501,502      | If the server is not working                        |

## License Software

---

- Gives legal protection to companies and developers to modify and then sell (your version)

- Some popular License:
  - Apache : You ca modify it and then you can also sell it.
  - GPL used by LINUX : You can modify it but have to submit it to Linux.
  - BSD
  - MIT

## Database

---

| Relational | Non-Relational |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Mysql      | MongoDB        |
| MariaDB    | NeoJS          |

## Cloud Providers

---

- Helps us with the system setup.
- Some popular cloud provider are:
  - AWS
  - Azure
  - BlueMix
  - Vultr
- Cloud services includes : PAAS, SASS, IAAS.

## Code Repo's

---

- Github
- Gitlab
- BitBucket

## Infrastructure

---

- Dev
- UAT / Staging
- Production System

Note : Only DevOps guys will have access to UAT / Production System
